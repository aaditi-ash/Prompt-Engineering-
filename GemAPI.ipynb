      "1.  **Specificity:** Frame the open-ended prompt to invite specific details, emotions, or reasoning.\n",
      "2.  **Contextualization:** Provide context to the open-ended question, this allows the language model to generate more relevant and well-informed responses.\n",
      "3.  **Constraints:** Add a constraint to the response to help guide it to a good outcome.\n",

      "    *   **Response:** \"I understand that you are feeling sad today. Try to remember your happy memories. Listen to your favorite music, watch a movie, or call a friend.\"\n",

      "    *   **Response:** \"Yes, the weather is nice today. Depending on your preferences, you could go for a walk or bike ride, visit a park or botanical garden, or simply relax outdoors with a book or picnic.\"\n",
      "3.  **Original Prompt:** \"The movie was amazing.\"\n",
      "    *   **Optimization Method:** Contextualization and Constraint\n",
      "    *   **Optimized Prompt:** \"The movie was amazing. Provide a detailed summary of why the movie was amazing.\"\n",
      "    *   **Response:** \"The movie was amazing. The plot had very interesting twists and turns, it kept me on the edge of my seat. The characters are very likable and well-acted.\"\n",

      "*   **Iterate and refine:** Review the responses and adjust the prompts as needed to improve the quality and relevance of the answers.\n",

    "Prompt_Length: 20\n",
