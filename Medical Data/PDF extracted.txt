Background:
Prostate cancer is the most common malignant neoplasm in men, and radical prostatectomy is
among the primary therapies for localized prostate cancer. The biochemical recurrence-free sur-
vival rate 5 years after prostatectomy ranges from 70% to 90%. Improvements in the surgical
technique have decreased the amount of intraoperative blood loss occurring during radical prosta-
tectomy; however, substantial numbers of patients still require perioperative blood transfusions.
Blood transfusions are associated with adverse reactions, including postoperative infections and
transfusion-related immune perturbations. Allogeneic leukocytes present in the transfused blood
are thought to suppress host cellular immune responses. Furthermore, the immunodepressant ef-
fect is secondary to an imbalance of accumulated cytokines and proinflammatory mediators in
the transfused blood against decreased production of lymphocyte stimulating cell-mediated cy-
tokines, such as interleukin 2 and increased release of immunosuppressive prostaglandins in the
patient undergoing transfusion.
In cancer patients, perioperative blood transfusion has long been suspected of reducing long-term
survival, but available evidence is inconsistent. It is also unclear which components of transfused
blood underlie the cancer-promoting effects reported by some studies. An important factor asso-
ciated with the deleterious effects of blood transfusion is the storage age of the transfused blood
units. It is suspected that cancer recurrence may be worsened after the transfusion of older blood.
Study Objective:
This study evaluated the association between red blood cells (RBC) storage duration and biochem-
ical prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Specifically, tested was the hypothesis
that perioperative transfusion of allogeneic RBCs stored for a prolonged period is associated with
earlier biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after prostatectomy.4 covid_testing
Subjects and Variables:
Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 RBC age exposure groups on the basis of the terciles (ie, the
33rd and 66th percentiles) of the overall distribution of RBC storage duration if all their trans-
fused units could be loosely characterized as of ’younger,’ ’middle,’ or ’older’ age. Although this
approach resulted in the removal of certain patients with wide RBC age distributions, it has the
advantage of defining an essentially random and clearly separable exposure.
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was used as a biochemical marker of prostate cancer recurrence
after prostatectomy. A PSA value of at least 0.4 ng/mL (to convert to microg/L, multiply by 1.0)
followed by another increase was considered biochemical cancer recurrence.
The initial population consisted of 865 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy and re-
ceived transfusion during or within 30 days of the surgical procedure at Cleveland Clinic and had
available PSA follow-up data. Of these patients, 110 were excluded from the analysis because
they received a combination of allogeneic and autologous blood products. Of the remaining 755
patients, 405 (54%) received solely allogeneic and 350 patients (46%) received solely autologous
RBC units. Of the 405 patients who received allogeneic RBC transfusion, 89 were excluded be-
cause their transfused RBC age distribution included more than one of the terciles. Thus, this
dataset consists of the 316 patients who received solely allogeneic blood products and could be
classified into an RBC age exposure group.

Background
:
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the transplantation of multipotent hematopoi-
etic stem cells, from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. It is a medical
procedure most often performed for patients with certain cancers of the blood or bone marrow,
such as multiple myeloma or leukemia. Allogeneic HSCT involves two people: the (healthy)
donor and the (patient) recipient. Allogeneic HSC donors must have a tissue (HLA) type that
matches the recipient.
In myeloablative allogeneic HSCT, chemotherapy or irradiation is given immediately prior to a
transplant (the conditioning regimen) with the purpose of eradicating the patient’s disease prior
to the infusion of HSC and to suppress immune reactions. The bone marrow can be ablated (de-
stroyed) with dose- levels that cause minimal injury to other tissues. For many patients who are
at high risk for transplant-related mortality with myeloablative allogeneic HSCT, reduced- inten-
sity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant has proven effective. Although
the reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic HSCT may avoid many of the organ toxicities as-
sociated with myeloablative conditioning, the risk for developing graft-versus-host disease and
infection including cytomegalovirus remains significant.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that can infect almost anyone. Once infected, your
body retains the virus for life. Most people don’t know they have CMV because it rarely causes
problems in healthy people. But if pregnant or having a weakened immune system, CMV is
cause for concern. For people with compromised immunity, such as after allogeneic HSCT, CMV
infection can be fatal. Natural killer (NK) and T cells provide protection against CMV reacti-
vation. The reactivity of NK cells and some T-cell subsets are regulated by the interaction of
killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) with target cell HLA class 1 molecules. The donor
activating KIR genotype has been implicated as a contributing factor for CMV reactivation after
myeloablative allogeneic HSCT.
Study Objective:
This study investigates whether donor KIR genotype influences reactivation of CMV after T-cell
replete, matched sibling donor reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic HSCT.
Subjects and Variables:8 esoph_ca
The study included 64 consecutive patients who underwent T-cell replete, matched sibling donor
reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant between January 16,
2000 and April 24, 2007 at the Cleveland Clinic. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing on
donors and recipients was performed to allow assessment of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor
ligands (KIRs). To allow for comparison with previous studies, donors were categorized as having
1-4 or 5-6 activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptor genes (aKIRs).
CMV reactivation was defined as any detection of cytomegalovirus DNA in the blood; the lower
detection limit for this assay was 600 copies/mL.
The initial population consisted of 865 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy and re-
ceived transfusion during or within 30 days of the surgical procedure at Cleveland Clinic and had
available PSA follow-up data. Of these patients, 110 were excluded from the analysis because
they received a combination of allogeneic and autologous blood products. Of the remaining 755
patients, 405 (54%) received solely allogeneic and 350 patients (46%) received solely autologous
RBC units. Of the 405 patients who received allogeneic RBC transfusion, 89 were excluded be-
cause their transfused RBC age distribution included more than one of the terciles. Thus, this
dataset consists of the 316 patients who received solely allogeneic blood products and could be
classified into an RBC age exposure group.

An original base R dataset, though of somewhat unclear origin. The statistical textbook source is
clear, though it is not clear which of the original epidemiological papers on esophageal cancer in
Ille-et-Vilaine is referred to by this dataset. The original authors of the medical study were not
credited in the base R dataset. There are several possible papers in PubMed, none of which quite
match up with this dataset. This could be from Tuyns, AJ, et al., Bull Cancer, 1977;64(1):45-60, but
this paper reports 778 controls, rather than the 975 found here. A 1975 paper from the same group
reported 718 cases (Int J Epidemiol, 1975 Mar;4(1):55-9. doi: 10.1093/ije/4.1.55.). There is also
another possible source - a 1975 paper from the same group, Usefulness of population controls in
retrospective studies of alcohol consumption. Experience from a case–control study of esophageal
cancer in Ille-et-Vilaine, France , Journal of Studies on Alcohol, 39(1): 175-182 (1978), which is

Details
This data set contains data on 6 healthy volunteer subjects who participated in a pharmacokinetic
study of intravenous indomethacin. Indomethacin is an anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving non-
steroidal medication. It can be administered by the intravenous, oral, or rectal suppository routes.
Some of the indomethacin is excreted in the bile and reabsorbed by the intestine. This phenomenon,
called enterohepatic circulation, keeps the drug around longer than would be expected otherwise.
Each subject in Study 1 (intravenous route) received a single 50 mg dose of radioactively labeled
indomethacin (^14^-carbon-labeled, with each dose containing 25 microCuries of radioactivity).
Subjects received a standard meal (one 8-oz can of Metrecal, 8 oz of whole milk, and one medium-
size apple) 30 rain prior to medication and 8 oz of water every 2 hr throughout the waking hours to
ensure adequate urine output.
Blood samples were taken at frequent intervals over the first 8 hours after dosing, and the quantity
of indomethacin in the plasma (as well as stool and urine) at each time point was measured in mi-
crograms per milliliter. This data set only contains the plasma measurements from Table 1 on page
258 of the manuscript. While this paper was published in 1976 (post-Tuskegee reveal), there is no
mention of ethics review, IRB review, or consent of the healthy volunteers.
The abstract from the original manuscript:
There are no discernible quantitative differences in the biotransformation and the excretion of in-
domethacin following oral, rectal, and intravenous administration of indomethacin-2-^14^C. Ap-
proximately 50% (range 24-115% for n = 6) of an intravenous dose undergoes enterohepatic cir-
culation. Thus the bioavailability of indomethacin to the systemic circulation may exceed the ad-
ministered dose. Relative to the intravenous dose, indomethacin is 80 and 100% bioavailable from
suppositories and capsules, respectively. Absorption and/or reabsorption appears to be more rapid
and uniform by the rectal route. Recognition of the attributes of biliary recycling also helps to ex-
plain the observed variability in apparent plasma half-life, while their neglect requires alternative
explanations for anomalies between the disappearance rate from plasma and the corresponding ap-
pearance rate in urine.

Details
ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatogram, is a procedure performed by threading
an endoscope through the mouth to the opening in the duodenum where bile and pancreatic diges-
tive juices are released into the intestine. ERCP is helpful for treating blockages of flow of bile
(gallstones, cancer), or diagnosing cancers of the pancreas, but has a high rate of complications
(15-25%).
The occurrence of post-ERCP pancreatitis is a common and feared complication, as pancreatitis can
result in multisystem organ failure and death, and can occur in ~ 16% of ERCP procedures.
The inflammatory cytokine storm that can result from this procedural complication can be quite
severe. Several small randomized trials suggested that anti-inflammatory NSAID therapies at the
time of ERCP could reduce the rate of this complication, but all were rather small single-center
studies, and were not sufficiently convincing to change practice.
Elmunzer, Higgins, and colleagues performed a meta-analysis of these small trials, which sug-
gested that this was a significant effect, and that indomethacin could result in a 64% reduction in
post-ERCP pancreatitis.
The investigators took this as a possible over-estimate of the effect (due to publication bias), and
designed a multicenter RCT of a planned 948 patients to see a reduction of 50% from a placebo rate
of 10% to an indomethacin rate of 5%. Two interim analyses were performed, after 400 and 600
patients were enrolled, using an alpha spending function. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board
stopped the study after 602 participants were enrolled because of the significantly positive effect of
indomethacin, which reduced post-ERCP pancreatitis from 16% in the placebo group to 9% in the
indomethacin group.

Difficult and failed tracheal intubations are among the principal causes of anesthetic-related mor-
tality and morbidity. Because a good laryngeal view facilitates successful tracheal intubation, new
technologies have been introduced to improve visualization. Video laryngoscopes, for example,
often use miniature cameras to facilitate visualization of the laryngeal inlet with no need to align
the oral, pharyngeal, and tracheal axes.
The Pentax AWS is a novel video laryngoscope, available in Japan since 2006, which is designed
to facilitate intubation by providing a video image of the glottis. It incorporates a miniature video
camera and a battery-powered, built-in LCD monitor. A disposable blade is attached to the base
system. Incorporation of an LCD display makes it possible to view the glottis simultaneously with
insertion of the endotracheal tube (ETT). In this regard, it differs from some other video laryngo-
scope designs that use external monitors. The Pentax AWS also differs in having a side channel that
positions and guides the ETT. Reports suggest that the Pentax AWS can help intubate, but random-
ized data remain sparse.cr This study tested the hypothesis that intubation with the Pentax AWS
would be easier and faster than with a standard Macintosh laryngoscope with a #4 blade.

Postoperative sore throat is a common and annoying complication of endotracheal intubation. In-
tubation with double-lumen tubes, which are much larger than conventional single-lumen tubes,
are especially likely to provoke sore throats, with a reported incidence up to 90%. Presumably,
postoperative sore throats are a consequence of local tissue trauma, due to laryngoscopy and/or en-
dotracheal intubation, leading to inflammation of pharyngeal mucosa.
Nonpharmacological methods for preventing an intubation-related sore throat include using smaller-
sized endotracheal tubes, lubricating the endotracheal tube with water-soluble jelly, and careful
airway instrumentation as examples. Pharmacological measures for attenuating postoperative sore
throats include inhalation of beclomethasone or fluticasone propionate; gargling with azulene sul-
fonate, aspirin, or ketamine; and gargling or spraying benzydamine hydrochloride on the endotra-
cheal cuff for example. Each of these approaches and others not listed, however, has limitations and
variable success rates; thus none has become established or is in routine clinical use.
Recently, a study reported that gargling with licorice halves the risk of sore throat after intubation
with conventional endotracheal tubes, based on a study of just 40 patients. A number of active
ingredients have been isolated from licorice, including glycyrrhizin, liquilitin, liquiritigenin, and
glabridin. The glycyrrhizin component reportedly has anti-inflammatory and antiallergic proper-
ties. Liquilitin and liquiritigenin have peripheral and central antitussive properties. Glabridin has
significant antioxidant and ulcer-healing properties, which might help heal pharyngeal and tracheal
mucosa after minor injuries that often complicate laryngoscopy, intubation, and endotracheal tube
cuff inflation.
This study tested the hypothesis that gargling with licorice solution immediately before induction
of anesthesia prevents sore throat and postextubation coughing in patients intubated with double-
lumen tubes.

Background::
Randomized Clinical Trial on the Effect of Treatment of Maternal Periodontal Disease Can Re-
duce Preterm Birth Risk.
Maternal periodontal disease has been linked in observational studies to preterm birth (< 37
weeks) and low birth weight (< 2500 g) outcomes. The Obstetrics and Periodontal Therapy study
was a multi-center randomized trial evaluating the effect of nonsurgical periodontal treatment in-
tervention on preterm birth, comparing outcomes of women treated before 21 weeks gestation
(treatment) to those treated after delivery (control).
Preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, is a growing problem. In some
cases, preterm birth can lead to infant death; in others, its consequences may include neurode-
velopmental disabilities, cognitive impairment, and/or respiratory disorders in the child. Many
risk factors for preterm birth have already been identified, including maternal age, drug use, and
diabetes. However, such factors are exhibited in only about half of preterm birth mothers, high-
lighting a need to expand our understanding of what contributes to preterm birth risk.
Several observational studies have suggested an association between maternal periodontal disease
and preterm birth. Periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition characterized by the destruc-
tion of tissue and/or bone around the teeth. A major component of periodontal disease is oral
colonization by gram-negative bacteria; systemic release of cytokines and/or lipopolysaccharides
from these bacteria may impact fetal condition.
Inoculation of the periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis into pregnant animals does have a dose-
dependent effect on birth weight and preterm birth signaling, but no such causal link has been
shown in humans, only some associations. Though not definitive, the possibility of a significant
relationship raises the question of whether treatment of maternal periodontal disease can decrease
preterm birth risk.
Participants::
823 participants enrolled at 4 centers underwent stratified randomization, resulting in 413 women
assigned to the treatment group and 410 to control. All participants were 13-16 weeks pregnant
at time of randomization (baseline/visit 1) and went on to attend monthly follow-up visits defined
as visits 2, 3, 4, and 5 corresponding to gestational age ranges of 17-20, 21-24, 25-28, and 29-32
weeks.
Treatment::
The treatment group received periodontal treatment, oral hygiene instruction, and tooth polishing
at their follow-ups, while those assigned to control underwent only brief oral exams. Data collec-
tion occurred at visits 1 (baseline), 3, and 5. The primary outcome of interest is gestational age
at end of pregnancy. Additional outcomes include birthweight, clinical measures of periodontal
disease, and various microbiological and immunological outcomes.
Analysis::
Statistical analyses were carried out on an intent-to-treat basis. Gestational age can be thought of
as ’time until end of pregnancy,’ for which certain survival analysis methods would be appropri-
ate. The study used a log-rank test stratified by center to compare time until end of pregnancy for
treatment and control groups.26 polyps
A semiparametric proportional hazards model was also used for this purpose and incorporated
maternal risk factors as predictors. For the study’s main analyses, gestational age was censored at
37 weeks (259 days) because the interest was in extending pregnancies that would otherwise end
pre-term, not extending pregnancies generally.
Though not used in the study itself, logistic regression is another method that could be applied: for
example, to gestational age, dichotomized as ’preterm’ or ’not preterm’ according to a gestational
age cutoff, or to birthweight dichotomized as ’low’ or ’high’ at the 2500 g or other cutoff (2500
g would be in keeping with the World Health Organization’s definition for low birth weight).
Changes in clinical measures of periodontal disease from baseline to visits 3 or 5 could be ana-
lyzed using mixed effects linear models. The dataset also features a number of baseline charac-
teristics, which could be compared in treatment and control groups via Student t-tests, Wilcoxon
rank sum tests, Fisher’s exact tests or Pearson’s chi-square tests, as appropriate.
Publishing::
The nonsurgical periodontal treatment involving scaling and root planing induced significant im-
provements in periodontal health. The study did not however find a significant relation between
periodontal treatment and preterm birth risk. The results of this study were published in 2006 by
Michalowicz et al., ’Treatment of periodontal disease and the risk of preterm birth’, in The New
England Journal of Medicine. The Obstetrics and Periodontal Therapy Dataset contains the data
used in this study.

Details
FAP is an inherited condition caused by mutations in the APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) gene
that leads to early and frequent formation of precancerous polyps of the colon at a young age, and
invariably leads to the development of colon cancer at a young age.
Early, frequent surveillance colonoscopy and polyp removal is helpful, but this study examined
whether there is a beneficial effect of preventive medical therapy with the nonsteroidal pain reliever,
sulindac, versus placebo in a RCT vs placebo in 22 participants, with polyp number measured (via
colonoscopy) at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months after starting the study drug. Note that one
subject did not return for the 12 month colonoscopy.

Scurvy was a common affliction of seamen on long voyages, leading to mouth sores, skin lesions,
weakness of the knees, and lassitude. Scurvy could be fatal on long voyages. James Lind reported
the treatment of 12 seamen with scurvy in 1757, in A Treatise on the Scurvy in Three Parts . This
476 page bloviation can be found scanned to the Google Books website A Treatise on the Scurvy.
Pages 149-153 are a rare gem among what can be generously described as 400+ pages of evidence-
free blathering, and these 4 pages may represent the first report of a controlled clinical trial.
Lind was the ship’s surgeon on board the HMS Salisbury, and had a number of scurvy-affected
seamen at his disposal. Many remedies had been described and advocated for, with no more than
anecdotal evidence. On May 20, 1747, Lind decided to try the 6 available therapies at his disposal
in a comparative study in 12 affected seamen. He selected 12 with roughly similar severity, with
notable skin and mouth sores, weakness of the knees, and significant lassitude, making them unfit
for duty. They each received the standard shipboard diet of gruel and mutton broth, supplemented
with occasional biscuits and puddings. Each treatment was a dietary supplement (including citrus
fruits) or a medicinal.
This data frame was reconstructed from Lind’s account as recorded on these 4 pages, with his esti-
mates of severity translated to a 4 point Likert scale (0-3) for each of the symptoms he described at
his chosen endpoint on day 6. A fanciful study_id variable was added, along with detailed descrip-
tions of the dosing schedule of each treatment.
Of note, there is some dispute about whether this was truly the first clinical trial, or whether it ac-
tually happened. See link about the historical debate. Lind reported that the seamen treated with 2
lemons and an orange daily did best, followed by those treated with cider. Those treated with elixir
of vitriol only had improvement in mouth sores. One imagines that acidic substances (like dilute
sulfuric acid, vinegar, cider, and citrus fruits) might have been rather painful on these mouth sores.
Unfortunately, the burial of 4 valuable pages of data in 476 pages of noise, a publication delay of
10 years, and Lind’s half-hearted conclusions, meant that it took until 1795 before the British Navy
mandated daily limes for seamen.smartpill 29

This study evaluated gastric emptying, small bowel transit time, and total intestinal transit time in
8 critically ill trauma patients. These data were compared with those obtained in 87 healthy volun-
teers from a separate trial. Data were obtained with a motility capsule that wirelessly transmitted
pH, pressure, and temperature to a recorder attached to each subject’s abdomen. Transit times were
available for almost all patients, however, pH, pressure and temperature data is missing for all crit-
ically ill patients and sparsely missing for the healthy volunteers ( more details available below the

Delayed gastric emptying is a well-known problem in critically ill patients and is associated with
feeding disturbances and inadequate nutrition. However, evaluating gastrointestinal function re-
mains challenging in critically ill patients who are mechanically ventilated. Many tests that are
practical and accurate under standardized, controlled conditions often fail in the critical care setting.
For example, the consensus recommendations for gastric emptying scintigraphy are impractical in
intubated patients because they recommend low-fat, egg white meal with imaging at 0, 1, 2, and 4
hours after meal ingestion. Another test, the lactulose hydrogen breath test, relies on prompt bacte-
rial breakdown of lactulose in the colon; however, changes in bacterial flora - which are presumably
common in critical care patients - can produce false transit times.
The 13C-octanoic acid breath test was reported as successful when used bedside to measure gastric
emptying. However, manometry only assesses the upper gastrointestinal function, mainly esopha-
gus, stomach, and proximal small bowel. Finally, video capsule technology has been used to deter-
mine small bowel transit time and pathomorphology in critically ill patients, although inadequate
battery lifespan of the capsule (approximately 8-10 hours) could prevent complete examination in
some cases.
An alternative technique, wireless capsule technology, may be useful for evaluating gastrointestinal
motility in critical care patients. A newly developed motility capsule for assessing gastric emptying
in patients with suspected gastroparesis has been available since 2006. It is a wireless capsule that
transmits pH, pressure, and temperature.
This study describes the first use of a novel motility capsule to compare gastric emptying and small
bowel transit times in critically ill trauma patients with intracranial hemorrhage with times recorded
previously in healthy volunteers. Secondly, this study compares critically ill patients and volunteersstrep_tb 31

The Streptomycin for Tuberculosis trial in 1948 was considered the first modern randomized,
placebo-controlled clinical trial, which could be done in part because there were very limited sup-
plies of streptomycin in the UK after World War II.
This publication seems a bit primitive today, without standard features like a proper Table 1, and
some creative use of graphs to display baseline characteristics of the study sample
More strikingly, there is no ethics committee approval, or consent.
You can read the pdf of the original journal article at Streptomycin in TB Study.
This was the first of a series of 3 trials, in which the initial effectiveness of Streptomycin was es-
tablished, but rapid resistance developed, and significant side effects occurred at a dose of 2 grams
of streptomycin. This type of resistance also occurred with another new anti-tubercular therapy at
the time, PAS (Para-Amino-Salicylate). Subsequent trials B and C evaluated different doses and
combinations of Streptomycin and PAS, and were published together in 1952 in the BMJ, with the
pdf available here 1952 Three Streptomycin in TB Studies Summarized.

The choice of anesthetic technique combined with a suitable plan for postoperative analgesia can
facilitate early discharge, improve patient comfort, and increase overall satisfaction. Patients hav-
ing painful procedures who undergo general anesthesia have a 2- to 5-fold greater risk of unplanned
overnight admissions compared with those having regional anesthesia. Regional anesthetic tech-
niques and peripheral nerve blocks are especially favored for surgeries on the extremities. Both
rapid onset of the block and prolonged postoperative analgesia are desired characteristics of re-
gional anesthesia.
The choice of local anesthetics or combinations thereof can greatly influence the effectiveness of
the block, onset time, duration of postoperative analgesia, need for opioid use, and patient satisfac-
tion. Mepivacaine and ropivacaine are commonly used in peripheral nerve blocks, their drawbacks
being a short duration with 1.5% mepivacaine and a delayed onset with 0.5% ropivacaine. An ideal
local anesthetic with high potency, low toxicity, rapid onset, and prolonged duration does not exist
yet. Investigators have therefore tried mixtures of local anesthetics in an attempt to combine their
advantages with conflicting results. A potential problem is that mixing drugs dilutes the effects of
each. Thus, a mixture of a rapid-onset drug such as mepivacaine with a long-acting one such as
ropivacaine may well result in slower onset than mepivacaine alone and shorter duration of action
than ropivacaine alone. In contrast, sequential administration of the same amounts of the same
drugs may preserve the desirable features of each.
Objective: This study investigates whether sequential supraclavicular injection of 1.5% mepiva-
caine followed 90 seconds later by 0.5% ropivacaine provides a quicker onset and a longer duration
of analgesia than an equidose combination of the 2 local anesthetics.

Details
This data set is from a pharmacokinetic study of oral dosing of the anti-asthma medication, theo-
phylline, in 12 subjects over 25 hours, published By Dr. Robert A. Upton around 1980. The original
publication, if any, is unclear and not cited. These data were used in a package named nlme , and
reported in Boeckmann, A.J., et al.Dr. Upton did publish several papers on theophylline pharma-
cokinetics around 1980-1984, and these data could have been from one of these.
Theophylline is an methylxanthine anti-asthma medication, which acts as a bronchodilator, with
secondary effects to strengthen diaphragm contraction, reduce pulmonary artery pressures, and re-
duce mast cell release. It can be administered by the intravenous, oral, or rectal suppository routes.
Each subject in this Study (oral route) received a single oral dose of theophylline. Blood samples
were taken at frequent intervals over the first 25 hours after dosing, and the quantity of theophylline
in the plasma at each time point was measured in micrograms per milliliter.
Unfortunately, the theophylline plasma level in blood varies considerably between patients, be-
cause of differences in drug clearance, which is affected by body mass, age, smoking, liver and
heart function, and viral infections. To complicate this drug further, it has important interactions
with a number of other common medicines which can increase or decrease the drug level. Each sub-
ject in this study received a single oral dose of 300 mg of theophylline, which has been converted
to a milligrams per kilogram dose. Blood samples were taken at frequent intervals over the next 25
hours after dosing, and the quantity of theophylline in the plasma at each time point was measured
in micrograms per milliliter of plasma.
