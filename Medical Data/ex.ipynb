      "Prostate cancer is the most common malignant neoplasm in men, and radical prostatectomy is\n",
      "among the primary therapies for localized prostate cancer. The biochemical recurrence-free sur-\n",
      "vival rate 5 years after prostatectomy ranges from 70% to 90%. Improvements in the surgical\n",
      "technique have decreased the amount of intraoperative blood loss occurring during radical prosta-\n",
      "tectomy; however, substantial numbers of patients still require perioperative blood transfusions.\n",
      "Blood transfusions are associated with adverse reactions, including postoperative infections and\n",
      "transfusion-related immune perturbations. Allogeneic leukocytes present in the transfused blood\n",
      "are thought to suppress host cellular immune responses. Furthermore, the immunodepressant ef-\n",
      "fect is secondary to an imbalance of accumulated cytokines and proinflammatory mediators in\n",
      "the transfused blood against decreased production of lymphocyte stimulating cell-mediated cy-\n",
      "tokines, such as interleukin 2 and increased release of immunosuppressive prostaglandins in the\n",
      "patient undergoing transfusion.\n",
      "In cancer patients, perioperative blood transfusion has long been suspected of reducing long-term\n",
      "survival, but available evidence is inconsistent. It is also unclear which components of transfused\n",
      "blood underlie the cancer-promoting effects reported by some studies. An important factor asso-\n",
      "ciated with the deleterious effects of blood transfusion is the storage age of the transfused blood\n",
      "units. It is suspected that cancer recurrence may be worsened after the transfusion of older blood.\n",

The text says that the indomethacin arm had 9% of the 301 patients. Based on the statement, we can determine that 301 patients were in the placebo group, and 16% of the 301 patients experienced the outcome of pancreatitis. 301 \\* 0.16 = 48.16 or 48 pancreatitis cases.\n",
